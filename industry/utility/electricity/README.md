## Public Utility Energy Optimization

```
python3 sample/public_utility_energy_optimization.py
```

This Python script is designed to optimize energy rates for public utilities by identifying outliers and anomalies in utility data. 
The script leverages Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and the Isolation Forest algorithm for anomaly detection.

## Import Libraries

The following libraries are imported for processing data, performing machine learning operations, and managing gRPC communications:

```
import grpc
import vectordb_pb2
import vectordb_pb2_grpc
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.ensemble import IsolationForest
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
import csv
import time
```

## Function: `setup_grpc_channel`

Establishes a gRPC channel for communication with VectorDB service.

```
def setup_grpc_channel():
# ... Function implementation ...
```

## Function: `utility_data_to_vectors`

Applies PCA to utility rate data to reduce the feature space into principal components for further analysis.

```
def utility_data_to_vectors(df):
# ... Function implementation ...
```

## Function: `write_utility_data_to_database`

Writes the vectorized utility data into VectorDB, which can be used for comparison and analysis.

```
def write_utility_data_to_database(df, stub):
# ... Function implementation ...
```

## Function: `search_for_anomalies`

Performs a semantic search in the vector database to find utility rates similar to the provided query vector.

```
def search_for_anomalies(query_vector, stub):
# ... Function implementation ...
```

## Function: `detect_anomalies`

Uses the Isolation Forest algorithm to identify anomalous utility rates that deviate significantly from typical patterns.

```
def detect_anomalies(df):
# ... Function implementation ...
```

## Function: `process_anomalies_for_optimization`

Processes the anomalies to extract actionable insights and strategies for optimizing utility rates.

```
def process_anomalies_for_optimization(df, stub):
# ... Function implementation ...
```

## Main Function

Orchestrates the entire process from loading the data, writing to the database, detecting anomalies, and generating a report.

```
if name == 'main':
main()
